       <p> Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.</p> It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript and VBScript.

<p>Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages.</p> HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.
